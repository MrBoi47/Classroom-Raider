# Classroom-Raider
Automatically searches for meet codes to join so you can raid them :)

First you need pynput installed (pip install pynput).
After, run the script and input how many codes you want to try.
Next, quickly click onto the "Enter code or link" section on https://meet.google.com/

Enjoy!
